RSTM Release 7 Notes

The latest RSTM release features the following changes:

- Support for the Intel Transactional C++ Compiler

- Support for 64-bit environments

- New build system based on cmake

- Support for dynamic profiling of transactions, and machine-learning-based
  adaptivity policies

Important Build Notes

- We strongly encourage you to build **outside** of the source tree.  The
  following example assumes that you have this file located in
  /home/yourname/rstm:

  cd /home/yourname/
  mkdir rstm_build
  cd rstm_build
  cmake ../rstm
  make

- If you want to specify build options (e.g., 32-vs-64-bit), you can do an
  interactive configure by setting the '-i' flag when invoking cmake:

  cmake ../rstm -i
